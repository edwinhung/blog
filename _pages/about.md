Hi! My name is Edwin Hung. I am currently an analyst at FEV Analytics, a fintech startup in Kirkland, WA.
I have strong interest data science and machine learning since I began my journey 
with [fastai course](https://course.fast.ai/) and the book Practical Deep Learning for Coders by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger.

This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1].
