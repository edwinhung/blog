            "title": "Covid-19 Impact on Businesses in Bellevue, WA",
            "content": "Introduction . It has been more than two years since Covid-19 pandemic started in the U.S. Though our lives are getting back to normal, Covid&#39;s impact to our society is significant. A few weeks ago, my wife told me about her observation that it seemed like there were a lot more small businesses poping up near the area where we lived on Google Map, and she speculated that is was mainly due to Covid&#39;s influence. So, I decided to prove or disprove this by applying my data analysis skill, and I will walk through how I did it in this post. . Dataset . Thanks to City of Bellevue | Open Data, I download Business Listing dataset here on May 29,2022. It&#39;s a tabular data containing information of new business such as names, addresses and start date. There are 41,407 business with start date ranging from 1953 to 2022 . business = pd.read_csv(&quot;data/Business_Listing.csv&quot;, low_memory=False) for date_col in [&#39;CancelDate&#39;,&#39;FirstActivityDate&#39;,&#39;IssueDate&#39;]: business[date_col] = pd.to_datetime(business[date_col]) . . business.shape[0], business[&#39;IssueDate&#39;].min(),business[&#39;IssueDate&#39;].max() . . (41407, Timestamp(&#39;1953-01-01 08:00:00+0000&#39;, tz=&#39;UTC&#39;), Timestamp(&#39;2022-05-26 06:59:59+0000&#39;, tz=&#39;UTC&#39;)) . Objective . The goal is to determine whether more people are starting their own businesses in Bellevue. It&#39;s also interesting if we can get an insight of what these business do. . Preprocess Data . There are some preprocessing steps we need to do so that we can have not only a clean dataset but additional data not already existed in the original dataset. Here are the first 5 rows: . business.head() . . X Y ObjectId BusinessFactId BusinessId LegalEntityName Dba Ubi Naic LegalEntityType ...

Since we are interested in Covid&#39;s influence on new businesses, IssueDate (start date) would be critical to help us determine the business started before or after pandemic. We will drop 217 business with missing IssueDate. . print(business[&#39;IssueDate&#39;].isna().sum()) business = business.dropna(subset=[&#39;IssueDate&#39;]) . . 217 . The dataset also has Naic column, which stands for North American Industry Classification, often called NAICS code. This system classifies businesses by their types of economic activity and assign codes to uniquely identify the classification. We can extract sector and industry information from NAICS code for each business, which is extremely helpful for visualizing business trend based on their economic activities. I also package the functions to convert NAICS codes to sectors and industries and upload to PyPI. Here is a sample of result: . business[&quot;Sector&quot;] = naics2sectors(business[&quot;Naic&quot;]) business[&quot;Industry&quot;] = naics2industries(business[&quot;Naic&quot;]) business[&#39;Year&#39;] = business[&#39;IssueDate&#39;].dt.year business[[&#39;LegalEntityName&#39;,&#39;Dba&#39;,&#39;Sector&#39;,&#39;Industry&#39;]].head(2) . . LegalEntityName Dba Sector Industry . 0 ABACUS SCIENTIFIC INC | ABACUS SCIENTIFIC | Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services | Other Computer Related Services | . 1 BELLEVUE SUNFLOWER DAYCARE,LLC | BELLEVUE SUNFLOWER DAYCARE | Educational Services | Educational Support Services | . Addresses . My initial approach is to classify businesses based on whether the address is residential or commercial by fetching residential delivery indicator(RDI). Unfortunately, it&#39;s only feasible with paid API (which I am reluctant to get for a hobby project). But, we can still plot business locations on a map. Mapbox provides free limited API request for its awesome Maps service. In addition, we use lock down date, March 24, 2020, to divid businesses into pre-covid and post-covid, and truncate the dataset to keep only businesses with IssueDate after 2017 to avoid pre-covid business overwhelm post-covid ones in the plots, and the time intervals are very close between pre-covid and post covid, which are both about 2 years and 3 months. . # business[&#39;post_covid&#39;] = (business[&#39;IssueDate&#39;] &gt;= &#39;2020-03-24&#39;) # business = business[business[&#39;Year&#39;]&gt;2017] # with open(&#39;mapbox_token.json&#39;,&#39;r&#39;) as openfile: # mapbox_token = json.load(openfile) # px.set_mapbox_access_token(mapbox_token[&#39;token&#39;]) # fig = px.scatter_mapbox(business,lat=&#39;Y&#39;,lon=&#39;X&#39;,color=&#39;post_covid&#39;,zoom=10, # hover_name=&#39;LegalEntityName&#39;,opacity=0.6,title=&#39;Business Listing in Bellevue Pre/Post Covid-19&#39;) # fig.show() ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/bellevue_business/map_plot.png) # Map by Plotly.js can&#39;t be properly render by fastpages . . Blue dots represent post-covid businesses, and we can see they are more spread out. This may implies post-covid new businesses tend to locate in residential area, but we can&#39;t draw a conclusion merely based on the map plot. Let&#39;s see if we can find other useful insights from the dataset. . Sector and Industry . With sector and industry data extracted from NAICS code, we can plot composition of business activities by year and compare them. Let&#39;s first plot sectors in pie charts by each year from 2018 . all_sectors = business[&#39;Sector&#39;].value_counts() labels = all_sectors.index.to_list() colors = dict(zip(labels,plt.cm.tab20.colors[:len(labels)])) colors[&#39;Other&#39;] = plt.cm.tab20_r.colors[2] def plot_sector(year): plt.figure(figsize=(12,8)) sector_count = business[business[&#39;Year&#39;]==year][&#39;Sector&#39;].value_counts() sector_count[10] = sum(sector_count[10:]) sector_count = sector_count[:11] sector_index = sector_count.index.to_list() sector_index[10] = &#39;Other&#39; sector_count.index = sector_index explode = np.zeros(11) explode[sector_index.index(&quot;Accommodation and Food Services&quot;)] = 0.35 ax = sector_count.plot.pie(autopct=&#39;%1.1f%%&#39;,explode=explode,wedgeprops={&#39;linewidth&#39;: 1.0, &#39;edgecolor&#39;: &#39;white&#39;},colors=[colors[key] for key in sector_count.index],textprops={&#39;fontsize&#39;:12}) plt.title(year) plt.ylabel(&quot;&quot;) plt.tight_layout() . . for year in sorted(business[&#39;Year&#39;].unique(),reverse=True): plot_sector(year) plt.show() . . Altough sector distribution doesn&#39;t vary much, we can tell Accommodation and Food Services shows a slight down trend since 2020, which could be a result of the pandemic. Let&#39;s look at industry data. . industry_dict = {} post_covid = set() pre_covid = set() for year in sorted(business[&#39;Year&#39;].unique(),reverse=True): industry_count = business[business[&#39;Year&#39;]==year][&#39;Industry&#39;].value_counts() industry_count = industry_count[:10] industry_dict[year] = industry_count.index if year &lt; 2020: pre_covid.update(industry_count.index) else: post_covid.update(industry_count.index) pd.DataFrame(industry_dict) . . 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 . 0 Custom Computer Programming Services | All Other Professional, Scientific, and Techni... | Offices of Mental Health Practitioners (except... | Beauty Salons | Administrative Management and General Manageme... | . 1 Offices of Mental Health Practitioners (except... | Offices of Mental Health Practitioners (except... | All Other Professional, Scientific, and Techni... | Full-Service Restaurants | Beauty Salons | . 2 Residential Remodelers | All Other Personal Services | Administrative Management and General Manageme... | Custom Computer Programming Services | Custom Computer Programming Services | . 3 All Other Professional, Scientific, and Techni... | Custom Computer Programming Services | Custom Computer Programming Services | Offices of Real Estate Agents and Brokers | Offices of Real Estate Agents and Brokers | . 4 Beauty Salons | Beauty Salons | Other Activities Related to Real Estate | Other Activities Related to Real Estate | Other Activities Related to Real Estate | . 5 Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings | Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings | All Other Personal Services | Offices of Mental Health Practitioners (except... | All Other Professional, Scientific, and Techni... | . 6 Offices of All Other Miscellaneous Health Prac... | Offices of Lawyers | Residential Remodelers | Residential Remodelers | Residential Remodelers | . 7 All Other Personal Services | Independent Artists, Writers, and Performers | Beauty Salons | All Other Professional, Scientific, and Techni... | Marketing Consulting Services | . 8 Independent Artists, Writers, and Performers | Residential Remodelers | Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings | Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings | Offices of Mental Health Practitioners (except... | . 9 Marketing Consulting Services | Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses | Independent Artists, Writers, and Performers | Limited-Service Restaurants | Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses | . Since there are too many levels in Industry column (492 of them), we rank industries by the number of businesses for each year in descending order (industries on the top has the most businesses) and show the top 10 industries. Full-Service Restaurants is pushed out of the top 10 despite ranking second in 2019. A histogram of Full-Service Restaurants: . plt.figure(figsize=(10,6)) restaurants = business.query(&#39;Industry == &quot;Full-Service Restaurants &quot;&#39;) plt.hist(x=restaurants[&#39;IssueDate&#39;],bins=30) plt.title(&#39;Full-Service Restaurants&#39;,fontdict={&#39;size&#39;:20}) plt.ylabel(&#39;Count&#39;) plt.tight_layout() . . It&#39;s clear that Full-Service Restaurants shows Covid-19 impact and has decreased in number begining the pandemic, which is in line with what we see in the news. . Let&#39;s try a different way to better visualize Covid-19&#39;s impact on industries. We can compute changes in number of businesses in each industry after Covid-19 and plot them in order. Absolute number of businesses won&#39;t make sense here, because numbers of businesses in different sectors and industries vary, as shown in pie charts. We will use percentage change in number of business and only include industries that have more than 70 businesses. . industry_count = business[&#39;Industry&#39;].value_counts() industries = industry_count[industry_count&gt;70].index industries_group = business[business[&#39;Industry&#39;].isin(industries)].groupby([&#39;Industry&#39;,&#39;post_covid&#39;],dropna=True).ObjectId.count() industries_change = industries_group.pct_change() post_covid = [idx[1] for idx in industries_group.index] industries_change_post = industries_change[post_covid].sort_values(ascending=False) industries_change_post = industries_change_post.reset_index() plt.figure(figsize=(14,10)) plt.hlines(y=industries_change_post.index,xmin=0,xmax=industries_change_post.ObjectId,color=plt.cm.coolwarm(np.linspace(0,1,20)), alpha=0.7,linewidth=10) plt.gca().set(ylabel=&#39;$Industry$&#39;, xlabel=&#39;$ % Change$&#39;) plt.yticks(industries_change_post.index,industries_change_post.Industry,fontsize=12) plt.title(&#39;Percentage Changes in Industries After Covid in Bellevue&#39;,fontdict={&#39;size&#39;:20}) txt=&quot;Changes in number of businesses are computed between pre-covid (2018-01-01 to 2020-03-22) and post-covid (2020-03-23 to 2022-05-26)&quot; plt.figtext(0.5, 0.03, txt, wrap=True, horizontalalignment=&#39;center&#39;, fontsize=12) plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(mtick.PercentFormatter(xmax=1.0)) plt.show() . . This is a much better visualization. Both Full-Service Restaurants and Other Activities Related to Real Estate are down more than 50% after the pandemic. More interestingly, Independent Artists, Writers, and Performers jumps about 130%! This number is significant enough that we can conclude many people are starting their businesses as artist or writers in Bellevue. Next time if you see a small photography company in Bellevue, you won&#39;t be surprised. I also wonder if this phenomenon may has something to do with record high job openings recently. That would be another project. . Conclusion . In order to show Covid-19 impact on businesses in Bellevue, we analyze and plot business listing dataset. The original dataset is not very useful for our objective, but we are able to extract sector and industry data from NAICS code, which turns out to be crucial to gain insights on how Covid-19 affect new businesses in Bellevue. Though we couldn&#39;t conclude that there are more small companies in residential area, the result shows Independent Artists, Writers, and Performers industry is booming. I can confidently tell my wife that many people in Bellevue are becoming artists and writers and starting their own businesses. I hope you learning something here. Thank you for reading! .",

            "title": "Bird Species Image Classifier with fastai",
            "content": "Introduction . Fastai is such an amazing framework that allows you to build state of the art neural net model with a few lines of code when you are only two lessons in its course. After completing the first part of fastai course, I decided to apply what I learnt to do this project (learn by doing is also taught in the course), and I will walkthrough my experience and result of the project in this post. . Often time, it’s common to see birds in an outdoor environment, making me wonder what species the birds are and how I should call them. Then, I found this great Kaggle dataset BIRDS 400 which made this project possible. The objective is to build a web app so that anyone can simply open it in a broswer, upload a bird image and get an answer quickly. . Training neural network with fastai . Install and import libraries . . Training process was done in Colab Pro !pip install timm, fastai from fastai.vision.all import * rom timm import create_model . Dataset . The Kaggle dataset contains 58388 training images, 2000 validation images and 2000 test images of 400 bird species. As the dataset provider Gerry mentions, this is high-quality dataset that each image has only one bird and bird’s portion of the image is more than 50%. Since Gerry had kindly done the hard work of cleaning the data, we can take a look at one image before proceeding. . img = (path/&#39;train&#39;/&#39;HOATZIN&#39;).ls()[0] PILImage.create(img) . . Construct DataLoaders . The main idea is using transfer learning to build a state-of-the-art deep learning model, which is efficient and saves a lot of training time. . Before we start training, we need to first create dataloaders which hold our training data in batches. These batches will later be sent in sequence to GPU to train our neural network. One part we are doing differently is randomly split data into training and validation instead of using the given sets, because Gerry notes in dataset description that both given validation and test sets are hand picked as the “best” images, resulting in high evaluation scores. We will still use the given test set as unseen data for evaluation, but keep in mind test set may not be representative of real world data. Let’s take a peek at one batch in dataloaders to make sure everything is okay: . . Pretrained Model with timm . timm is a wonderful library by Ross Wightman that provides state-of-the-art pretrained model for image classification. We will use one of the best models, Efficient Net, specifically “efficientnet_b3a”. For more details about timm, please refer to this repository. (timm is now integrated into fastai at the time of writing this blog post, check out timm.fast.ai) . Training . Let’s start training our model! As you know, learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameter in training neural network. Fortunately, fastai has convenient learning rate finder that gives us a sense of how changing learning rate affects losses in the model. . After picking a learning rate, we freeze all layers of neural net except the last one, and train 3 epochs. The last layer is created specifically for our task of classifying 400 bird species and is how we can do transfer learning. Result of training 3 epochs: . . Wow! We already reached 94.5% accuracy on validation set. We can push it further by unfreezing all layers and training it more. This time, we use discriminative learning rate which gradually increases learning rates for later layers, because later layers recognize more complex pattern in images. . . After 10 epochs, final accuracy is 95.17% on validation set. A look at the result on validation: . . Result . Finally, we evaluate the model on test set which is given and has not been seen in the training process. The result is surprisingly 99.4% accuracy on test set of 2000 images. Please note that this score is unlikely representative of real world generalization performance as described by Gerry, Kaggle dataset provider. Still, given the high score, we have our underlying model for web app and are ready for delopyment. . Depolyment . Depolying a machine learning model is not straightforward, especially for neural net, because our model is complex and big and library dependencies are also included in server space. In our case, directly depolying to Heroku would easily exceed 500GB server image size limit. So, how do we do it? We will first depoly the model above to Azure Function and let Heroku web app make request to Azure Function. . Microsoft Azure Function . Azure Function is a severless infrastructure provided by Microsoft Azure, simplifying management tasks. Thanks to fastai tutorial and this great guide, we can leverage optimized ONNX Runtime to greatly reduce memory footprint. In fact, the model depolyment package in onnx format is 47.5MB. Azure Function’s execution is triggered by HTTP request, so we can get prediction by sending a HTTP request with image parameter. Once we test the deployment on Azure Function is working as expected, we move on to build the final web app which is what our users will see and interact with. . Heroku and Voila . Since Azure Function offloads heavy tasks of model management, we build a plain web app which can be easily hosted on Heroku. We first utilize Voila to transform a jupyter notebook into interactive page and hosting it on Heroku is straightforward.(fastai offers tutorial on this part) The mechanism under the hood works as a user uploads a bird image to the web app which then makes HTTP request with image parameter to Azure Function and gets back a prediction from the model. . Conclusion . We have built an amazing bird image classifier with an underlying deep learning model capable of recognizing 400 bird species, hosted on Azure Function and Heroku. Anyone can go to this web app in a browser and get prediction from the model without any prerequisites. Try it out here. . Thanks for reading! For more details about this project, here is my repo. . Improvement . As my first project with fastai, I am happy that it’s up and running. However, I become aware of tons of room for improvement. . Before training neural network, I should explore and experiment the dataset, which helps to get insights on techniques to improve performance, such as data augmentation. | Training with the full dataset easily takes more than 30 minutes, so subsetting the dataset and work with the representative sample is a great way to experiment and test models. | Having a baseline model is critical in machine learning project workflow, because it helps to spot problems early on and also serves as a benchmark. | I could spend more time exploring other architectures than tuning hypterparaters on the model. | There are a lot more than I could mention here, including a different deployment. I will have these in mind on my next project. .",

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png .
